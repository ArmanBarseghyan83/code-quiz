# Code Quiz

## Description

This project taught me how to use The Document Object Model (DOM), setInterval(), localStorage.

## Usage

When a user clicks the start button a timer starts and they are presented with a question. When user answers a question incorrectly time will be subtracted from the clock by 10 seconds. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 they can save their initials and score.
